# famYOUly
Family app for raising a children

## Description 
In today’s day and age, families are so much more than a mom, dad, and 2.5 kids. Sometimes grandparents take on a larger role, or parents split up and children have bonus parents. We created FamYOUly as a way to tackle the arduous task that is parenting in this modern day and age. With FamYOUly you can collaborate with your child’s support network to post events, have a shared calendar, add todos. No more forgetting to buy a poster board for your kid’s science project and being reminded the night before. You now have a place to list medications, allergies, and other medication, so your babysitter is on the same page and doesn’t whip out the peanut butter and send little Johnny to the hospital on your girls’ night. Store important contacts so you remember teacher’s names, etc. Welcome to FamYOUly, it takes a village, and we are here to help.
